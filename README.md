# I'm Aviraj Saha

Languages? Python, JS, C/C++, Go—and yeah, I’m picking up Rust because of course I am. I live for AI rabbit holes, leetcode ladders, hackathon sprints, cybersecurity traps, system design rants, and open source bangers.

BUT WAIT—ever wonder how I stay in flow state? BOOM: tauconf.nvim. My surgically crafted, blazingly fast, “who-needs-an-IDE” Neovim config. It’s got the plugins, the mappings, the vibes. You want dotfiles? I got dotfiles. They're pinned. They're spicy. Go look.
